## Project Overview

*Echoes in the Mists* is a condensed Souls‑like developed by a small capstone team (Petrichor Studios) at RIT. You navigate a corrupted seaport as a knight, using tight melee combat, skill-chaining (“echoes”), and dramatic level shortcuts to explore and cleanse the Mists.

I served as **Lead Developer & Producer**, focusing on the architecture of gameplay systems, prototyping, and team coordination.

## Problem

Define the challenges you tackled:

- Building **modular gameplay systems** that support melee, dodge, healing, and echo abilities
- Structuring a **tight combat framework** within a small team and brief dev cycle
- Supporting **designer iteration** while keeping mechanics grounded and responsive
- Managing scope for a “bite-sized” demo with polished feel

---

## My Approach

Highlight your technical contributions:

- **Gameplay System Architecture**: Designed modular systems for dodge, attack, block, and echoes—using ScriptableObjects or data-driven setups to allow easy tuning by designers
- **Combat Loop Prototyping**: Rapid iteration cycles—recorded player feedback and adjusted frame timing, hitbox sizes, animation blend trees, etc.
- **Team Coordination & Tools**:
  - Set up **Git + branching** workflows to support parallel development
  - Created **template actors** for level designers to iterate without code
  - Led daily standups (Agile) to synchronize design and programming
- **Performance & UX**:
  - Built **checkpoint/shortcut system** supporting player return and flow
  - Optimized scene streaming and lighting for consistent frame rates

---

## Outcome

Explain the results of your efforts:

- Delivered a polished vertical slice with responsive combat, seamless fallbacks, and clear visual feedback
- Supported at least one full gameplay path with branching echoes and shortcuts under 1-hour playtime
- Earned positive feedback during official GDC demo presentation (New York State Pavilion, March ’25) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Showcased at RIT Imagine Festival under both art/design and computing categories :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Established a reusable foundation for future prototyping by keeping systems modifiable and well-documented

---

## Technologies & Tools

- Unity (2023+)
- C# with ScriptableObject-driven systems
- Git + GitHub workflow
- Agile standups and collaborative WIP demos
- Animator Controller & Timeline for combat flow
- Lightweight placeholder art scaled to playback

---

## My Role & Contributions

- **Lead Developer**: Architected core systems (combat, echo abilities, shortcuts)
- **Producer**: Organized team workflow, managed scope, and presented at GDC/RIT events
- **Tooling & Documentation**: Put in place content pipelines and editable templates for extended iteration

## Why It’s Valuable

This project not only demonstrates polished gameplay and system engineering—it shows your ability to:

1. Lead a **small multidisciplinary team**
2. Balance **technical vision with production scope**
3. Architect **data-driven systems** that are robust and scalable
4. Design for **rapid iteration and player feedback**
