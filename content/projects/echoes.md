## Overview

*Echoes in the Mists* is a retro-inspired horror Soulslike developed as my graduate capstone at RIT. Designed and built by a small multidisciplinary team, it was powered by my modular gameplay framework Mosaic and recognized at Imagine RIT, the GDC NYS Pavilion, and multiple RIT press features.

---

## Challenge

We aimed to build a punishing yet fair action-horror game that balanced deep systems with rapid iteration. With a limited team and timeline, we needed scalable tools to support player abilities, AI, combat, and environmental interactions—without slowing down content creation or introducing brittle dependencies.

---

## Approach

- Led system design and implementation across core gameplay: movement, combat, AI, and world interaction
- Built the game entirely on **Mosaic**, allowing rapid creation of new actors and systems without rewriting logic
- Supported team members (including non-engineers) in extending systems like animation events, modifiers, and scripted sequences
- Applied data-driven design throughout to maximize reusability and iteration speed

---

## Outcome

- Featured at **Imagine RIT** 2025, with high public engagement and faculty recognition
- Selected for the **NYS Pavilion at GDC**, where I presented the project and Mosaic architecture
- Backed by RIT and spotlighted on Facebook, RIT News, and the Imagine portal
- Enabled clean, scalable development of key gameplay mechanics including lock-on targeting, parry windows, boss transitions, and a fully modular backstab system
